Project Name: Deal or No Deal
Description: Like the game show Deal or No Deal a player/contestant will select a case for the end of the game they can chosse to keep based on values remaining. They will then select from other 25 cases and hope to get lower values so the banker will offer more money when they select certain amount of cases. When the banker offers money you say either Deal or No deal then when you get to the last offer you either choose the offer or what is in your case.
Credit: Had trouble increasing rounds by 1 each time round chnage so had to use global variable. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5532890/python-global-variable
Usage: When you run the code it will prompt what case you would like to select as your case, enter what number case you want. then round 1 will begin and you can select 6 cases until a banker offer pops up if you like the offer you can select y for yes or n for no and can continue to play if you select no.
